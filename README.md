<h1 align = "center"> Coding Quiz Game </h1>
To test our newly developed JavaScript skills and preparation for future coding challenges, I built an interactive, browser-based quiz application. This timed masterpiece, filled with multiple choice questions and sporting a dynamic, responsive UI, required us to code everything from scratch, HTML and CSS included, showcasing the power of pure JavaScript!

## Explanation of Video

Prepare to test your knowledge with this interactive quiz application! The homepage guides you through the process: click "Start Quiz" to begin facing 10 multiple-choice questions. Choose wisely as you have 100 seconds to answer all of them. Selecting the correct answer prompts a feedback message saying "correct!", while an incorrect answer prompts a feedback message saying "wrong!" and deducts 10 seconds from your remaining time. Don't worry, you'll automatically proceed to the next question even if you make a mistake.

A timer in the top right corner keeps track of your remaining time. Your score is determined by the time remaining when you answer the 10th question. Running out of time before completing the quiz unfortunately results in a zero score.

Once you finish the quiz, you can input your name to see your performance displayed on the High Score page. This page shows a ranked list of previous scores, with the highest scorers at the top. You can revisit this page anytime to admire your achievement or even clear the board and start afresh. Additionally, clicking "View High Scores" on the main page takes you directly to this page.

## Output

After tackling the 10-question challenge, your performance will be scored and added to the leaderboard.
