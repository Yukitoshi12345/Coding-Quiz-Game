<h1 align = "center"> Coding Quiz Game </h1>
To test our newly developed JavaScript skills and preparation for future coding challenges, I built an interactive, browser-based quiz application. This timed masterpiece, filled with multiple choice questions and sporting a dynamic, responsive UI, required us to code everything from scratch, HTML and CSS included, showcasing the power of pure JavaScript!

## Explanation of Video

Prepare to test your knowledge with this interactive quiz application! The homepage guides you through the process: click "Start Quiz" to begin facing 10 multiple-choice questions. Choose wisely as you have 100 seconds to answer all of them. Selecting the correct answer prompts a feedback message saying "correct!", while an incorrect answer prompts a feedback message saying "wrong!" and deducts 10 seconds from your remaining time. Don't worry, you'll automatically proceed to the next question even if you make a mistake.

A timer in the top right corner keeps track of your remaining time. Your score is determined by the time remaining when you answer the 10th question. Running out of time before completing the quiz unfortunately results in a zero score.

Once you finish the quiz, you can input your name to see your performance displayed on the High Score page. This page shows a ranked list of previous scores, with the highest scorers at the top. You can revisit this page anytime to admire your achievement or even clear the board and start afresh. Additionally, clicking "View Highscores" on the main page takes you directly to this page.

## Output

After tackling the 10-question challenge, your performance will be scored and added to the leaderboard.

## Central Grader Comments

Grade: 100/100

Congratulations on conquering the code quiz challenge! It's fantastic to see your deployed link functioning flawlessly, adhering to all the set criteria. The user interface and user experience (UI/UX) are clear and intuitive, ensuring the questions load smoothly. The penalty system for incorrect answers, implemented by subtracting time, adds a layer of engagement and keeps players on their toes. It's also impressive that you've integrated local storage to power the high scores page, fostering healthy competition among users. The addition of a well-written README and detailed commit messages in your repository demonstrates not only your coding proficiency but also your commitment to clean and well-documented code. This meticulous approach will make it a breeze for anyone to understand your project and future collaborators will surely appreciate it. Keep up the excellent work, Yukitoshi! Your dedication and attention to detail are truly commendable.
